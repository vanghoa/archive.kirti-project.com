              <b>KIRTI</b> explores contemporary art from Southeast Asia in
              alternative ways. This effort is vital as a countermeasure to art
              world silos and stratifications.
            </p>

          <div class="about-box" id="about-box-3">
            <p>
              <b>Why</b> : Art from Southeast Asian is underrepresented
              globally. Regional institutions often operate within political and
              creative constraints. Regional platforms often have limited reach
              and/or scope. Art is typically siloed by country, discipline,
              generation. Barriers of all kinds -- language, funding, sanction
              -- inhibit local art scenes.

            <p>
              <b>Methodology</b> : KIRTI works via an intuitive, on-the-ground
              methodology, deliberately seeking out artists and thinkers from
              across disciplines and generations. This is accomplished primarily
              through introductions from artists to fellow artists. Art scenes
              develop implicit hierarchies and factions. By adopting an
              informal, semi-randomized approach based around meeting people,
              KIRTI organically works across boundaries, which ultimately leads
              to a more diverse set of featured artists.

              <b>Content</b> : There is no prescriptive rubric for the content
              featured in KIRTI. Artists are invited to share artworks, process,
              unrealized projects, or anything else they feel called to.

              <b>What is “KIRTI:"</b> An iconographic motif found above the
              doorways of temples across South and Southeast Asia. The story
              goes that the god Shiva creates a demon of terrible appetite, with
              bulging eyes and unhinged jaw. But no sooner than creating the
              demon, Shiva orders it to eat itself. Obediently, the demon chews
              from its toes until only its floating head remains. Shiva is
              amazed. He saw in this monstrous self-consuming energy the perfect
              embodiment of life itself. Shiva declared the demon Kirti-Mukha –
              “glorious face” – and orders that it mark the threshold to his
              temples. As Shaivism expands from South Asia into Southeast Asia,
              the Kirti-Mukha image inevitably is transformed with new names and
              myths. For the Khmers, it became Rahu, the demon who eats the
              moon; for the Javanese, it became Batara Kala, lord of the
              underworld; for the Buddhist kings that co-opt Hindu temples, it
              became Kala, or Yama, incarnation of all-consuming time.
              Eventually, it was imported back into South Asia, changed in myth
              and aspect. Even now the face transforms.
